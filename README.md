`Microsoft Excel`

## Approach Used
1.Data Cleaning:
> Initiated the process by importing the raw sales data into Excel.
> Conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy, which included removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and standardizing formats across various columns. This step was crucial in preparing the data for accurate analysis.

2.Data Preparation:
> Utilized Power Pivot to efficiently manage the large dataset, enabling the integration of multiple data sources and the creation of relationships between tables.
> Created calculated columns and measures to derive key performance indicators (KPIs), such as customer net sales and profit margins.

3.Pivot Table Creation:
> Developed dynamic pivot tables to summarize the cleaned data. This allowed for quick comparisons and insights into customer performance, market targets, and fiscal metrics.
> Configured the pivot tables to display profit and loss analysis by fiscal year, as well as monthly breakdowns, facilitating an understanding of sales trends over time.

4. Reporting:
> Compiled the findings into a comprehensive Excel report.
> The report includes detailed insights into customer net sales performance, comparisons of market performance versus targets, and profit and loss evaluations for each country by fiscal period.
